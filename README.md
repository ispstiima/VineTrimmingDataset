# Vine Trimming Dataset
Dataset of images of vines before and after trimming. Captured by a Microsoft Azure Kinect DK in June 2022.

## Dataset description

The camera's intrinsic parameters, as generated by the MS Azure Kinect SDK (v1.4.1), are in the *Camera Intrinsics.txt* file. Translations and rotations move the color geometry to the depth one.
